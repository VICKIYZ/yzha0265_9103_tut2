### Our gorup has chosen the Saint-Georges majeur au creÃÅpuscule by Claude Monet to work with. Monet has used different layers of color to show the movement of the water and the position of sun in this painting. The example I found is from Text2Cinemagraph. They introcuced an automated method that generate cinemagraphs from text. They use stable diffusion to give the artistic image a nature infused movement. the artwork we choose is part of the view of an island so water movement can be implemented in our work aswell.

# Part 2
### Loops will be useful in implementing the desired movement. We need to define functions and use loops to constrain positions and colours, to implement intereations from users, and to draw on the canvas. Our work requires repetition in some areas which can be achieved using loops.
